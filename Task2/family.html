    <h2>BEAUTY OF FAMILY</h2>
    <p1>
        Family love each other no matter what happens . They <strong>lend listening  ears and open arms </strong>yearnings for each other's embrace.

    <h2 >MOTHER</h2>
    <p1>
        Mothers are guardian angles for their children,always loving and supporting them.   
    </p1>
    <h2 >FATHER</h2>
    <P2>
    Fathers, like mothers, are pillars in the development of a child's emotional well-being. Children look to their fathers to lay down the rules and enforce them.

    <h2>SIBLINGS</h2>
    <p3>
        A sibling is your brother or sister. It's that simple. The word sibling once meant anyone who is related to you, but now it's reserved for children of the same parent or parents.
